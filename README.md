# dotfiles
Scripts I found interesting that I want to keep on my system

Mostly inspired by https://evanhahn.com/scripts-i-wrote-that-i-use-all-the-time/

## Setup

To set up these dotfiles on a new system, use the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neilkakkar/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```

This will create symbolic links from the home directory to the files in this repository.
Make sure to review the `install.sh` script before running it to ensure it meets your needs.
